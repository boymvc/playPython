# Fort Knox
Fort Knox stores all the gold in the USA. There is a lock that only two people know the password to Fort Knox, Luke and Barry. Luke and Barry went to a bar and got in an arguement. Luke say the password is 1234 you can answer 09758481234 and it would still work so it is a national security weakness but Barry said that it is the only way he can get into Fort Knox. Things got heated and they ended up shotting eachother. Now nobody knows the password and so I created this repo that will find the best way to find the password. Have fun.*
